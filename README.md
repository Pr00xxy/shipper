# Shipper

This project is based on the concept of atomic deployments with focus on modularity.
Shipper does nothing except creating and maintaining the atomic deployment structure.

Any implementation or custom integrations are done by the user with the use of hooks.

This project is a pet project. Distributed publicly in the hopes that someone finds it useful
